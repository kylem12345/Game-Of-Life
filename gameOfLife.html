        <h1>Game of Life</h1>
        
        
        <canvas id="gameCanvas"  width="300" height="300" style="border: 3px solid">   </canvas>
        
        <p>
        Please input a number between 0 and 8. Press Fill Cell to add a live cell to that space. Once you have a set up you like press next turn button to see how the game of life progresses. Space 0 is the top left cell and space 8 is the bottom right. Once you have picked your starting seed you cannot add to it. Make sure you are happy with your starting seed before pressing the next turn button. If you want to start a new grid press the start again button.
        </p>
        <input type="number" id="cellNo" value="0" max="8" min="0" maxlength="1">
        
        <button id="turnButton" onclick="fillCell()">Fill Cell </button>

        <button onclick="nextTurn()">Next Turn</button>
        
        <button onclick="startAgain()">Start Again</button>
        <p>
            Assumptions I made about the problem.
            I assumed that the user would be able to pick thier own starting seed.
            I assumed that the user would be allowed to progress the game at thier own pace using a button to move on to the next turn
